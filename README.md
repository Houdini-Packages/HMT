**Houdini Music Toolset**, extends the users' capabilities into the domain of music composition.

HMT makes use of Houdini's powerful geometry and simulation processing in a set of new tools and workflows specifically designed for music. It uses point clouds and attributes within the graphical 3D environment to perform sequencing tasks present in music composition packages. It uses CHOPs as a back-end to import or export MIDI file data either to the midi file format, or directly to a MIDI port. It allows for artists or composers to make use of powerful simulation tools and Houdini's open node-based architecture normally dedicated to producing photorealistic simulations of natural phenomenon and apply the same tools if desired to manipulating or generating patterns of notes.

Because of the modular and node based nature of the toolset present in HMT, and that it adheres when possible to existing Houdini conventions, it allows users to easily develop their own workflows and tools for music creation or processing.

### Installation:

Download the desired release directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/andrew-lowell/HMT/releases) and extract it to your hard drive or network share.

**Plugin (17.5+ only)**
Create a folder inside your Houdini preferences directory (where the houdini.env typically lives) called "packages", and place the HMT.json file from the HMT download into that folder. Then edit HMT.json and change the "HMT" variable to match the install path.

### Developers:

Reserved point attributes include:
* f@mops_falloff: the falloff value generated by Falloff nodes. A value of 0 implies that no effect will take place.
* i@mops_index: The index attribute used to decide what object is cloned to what point, if multiple objects are connected to the MOPs Instancer multi-input.
* p@mops_orient: An orientation offset to allow for changes of the local rotation frames without actually rotating the object.
* v@euler: Created internally by the Transform Modifier. If detected, the Apply Attributes SOP will apply these rotations to the incoming points instead of using p@orient. This is to prevent flipping when animating rotations beyond 180 degrees on a given axis.

HMT (Houdini Music Toolset) is developed and maintained by Andrew Lowell.
