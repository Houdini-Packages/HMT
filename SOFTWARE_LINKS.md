### Useful Software when used in Conjunction with HMT:
**[loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) forms a virtual MIDI port on Windows**. This can then be used to send MIDI data directly to audio and sequencer software without an external device or cable.

**Audio sampler/sequencing software.** Popular audio sampler/synthesizer software includes **Reason**, **Ableton**, or other commercial and free applications. The HMT does not produce audio directly. It sends MIDI notes and events via the MIDI Out CHOP to your application of choice to produce the sound.

Here is a [template repository](https://github.com/andrew-lowell/HMT/tree/master/sampler_templates) for common audio sampler software to get up and running quickly with 3D/spacial music composition.
